# KarlsMvcDemo

This is a basic intro to straight ASP.Net MVC, as well as a small example on talking to Azure Table storage.

## Running the App

The default virtual directory is localhost/KarlsMvcDemo.  Navigating here will load the Main Index view.

NOTE: You'll need to edit the `_connectionString` value in  KarlsMvcDemo/KarlsMvcDemo/Services/MainModelService.cs in order for this to run correctly.

The inspiration for the table storage example was taken from [here](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Managing-Concurrency-using-56018114/sourcecode?fileId=123913&pathId=50196262).
